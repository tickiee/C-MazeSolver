This unit test is created by me.
This unit test is the same as test 1 except the initial and end positions are swapped
This is to make sure that even if the initial and end positions are different in any maze, the outputs
of milestone 2 and 3 are still correctly displayed.

Milestone 2:
All reachable paths must be displayed.

Milestone 3:
Only one best path has to be displayed and this test will test for it.
