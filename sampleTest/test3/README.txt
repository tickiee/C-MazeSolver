This unit test is created by me.
This unit test is created to test if each position has the correct distance.

Milestone 2:
All reachable paths must be displayed.

Milestone 3:
A position's distance number should be based on how close it is to the initial position.
Therefore, there should only be one path and it will be based on the distance variable.
