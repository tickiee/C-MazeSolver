This unit test is created by me.
This unit test is created to test if the best path is displayed when there is a loop.

Milestone 2:
All reachable paths must be displayed.

Milestone 3:
There are 2 different paths the robot can take but the robot should only take the shortest path.
The shortest path should be displayed.
